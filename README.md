# encryptor3
## About
A Delphi project to encrypt and decrypt strings using the various encryption techniques used by what was originally known as TurboPower LockBox, but has been revamped and renamed to [TurboPack LockBox3](https://github.com/TurboPack/LockBox3). This project has been tested to compile and run under Delphi 10.1 Berlin, 10.2 Tokyo, and 10.3 Rio.
## History
This project originally started as just [Encryptor](https://github.com/corneliusdavid/encryptor) and used [LockBox 2.08](https://github.com/corneliusdavid/LockBox-2.08).
## Disclaimer
This code is to be used for educational or internal use only. It has not been fully tested, but is simply a tool I built to create simple license keys I can ship with my software and decrypt at run-time.
